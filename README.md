##  Introduction  

This assignment explores **Reinforcement Learning** concepts through four problems.

Each problem builds upon the previous one, moving from defining state, actions, rewards to Monte Carlo methods, providing practical insights into RL algorithms.

## Setup Instructions  

### 1. Clone the repository  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Christo-Conestoga/RL-Assignment1.git
cd RL-Assignment1
```
### 2. Make sure you are having python verion 3.12.0
```bash
python --version
```

### 3. Create and activate a virtual environment in the cloned repo
```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 4. Install the requirements from requirements.txt
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 5. Now you must run the notebook in sequential order or you can use rull-all button to run all the cells.
